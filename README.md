# ft_printf
This was the first draft of the code I wrote for my 42Wolfsburg ft_printf project. I wrote all the codes using basic C style, making it very easy for beginners to read in case you're at a loss on how to begin writing your codes for the ft_printf project.  
The project doesn't permit using any function from any of the standard libraries.
NB: Although this code covers almost all the bases for the original printf conversion that the ft_printf project mandatory part requires(%s, %c, %d, %i, %X, %x, %p... besides the return value), I made several modifications and upgrades in the final version I submitted for evaluation.
